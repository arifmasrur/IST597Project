# IST597 Project

In this class project I investigate performance of different Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques in providing valuable insights on the Arctic wildfire-climate relationships. 

Algorithms Used: 

1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine 
4. Random Forest
5. AdaBoost
6. XGBoost
